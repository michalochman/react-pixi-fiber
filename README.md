# ReactPixiFiber – React Fiber renderer for PIXI.js

ReactPixiFiber is a JavaScript library for writing PIXI.js applications using React declarative style in React 16.

For React <16.0.0 see [react-pixi](https://github.com/Izzimach/react-pixi).

## Demo

See [Rotating Bunny](https://codesandbox.io/s/q7oj1p0jo6) demo.


## Usage

### With ReactDOM

```jsx harmony
import { render } from "react-dom";
import { Sprite, Stage } from "react-pixi-fiber";
import bunny from "./bunny.png";

function Bunny(props) {
  return (
    <Sprite texture={PIXI.Texture.fromImage(bunny)} {...props} />
  );
}

render(
  <Stage width={800} height={600}>
    <Bunny x={200} y={200} />
  </Stage>,
  document.getElementById("container")
);
```

This example will render PIXI.js [Sprite](http://pixijs.download/release/docs/PIXI.Sprite.html) object into a [root Container](http://pixijs.download/release/docs/PIXI.Application.html#stage) of PIXI Application on the page.

The HTML-like syntax; [called JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html) is not required to use with this renderer, but it makes code more readable. You can use [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) with a [React preset](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/preset-react/) to convert JSX into native JavaScript.


### Without ReactDOM

```jsx harmony
import { render, Text } from "react-pixi-fiber";
import * as PIXI from "pixi.js";

// Setup PIXI.js Application
const canvasElement = document.getElementById("container")
const app = new PIXI.Application(800, 600, {
  view: canvasElement
});

render(
  <Text text="Hello World!" x={200} y={200} />, 
  app.stage
);
```

This example will render PIXI.js [Text](http://pixijs.download/release/docs/PIXI.Text.html) object into a [root Container](http://pixijs.download/release/docs/PIXI.Application.html#stage) of PIXI Application (created as `app`) inside the `<canvas id="container"></canvas>` element on the page.


## Running Examples

1. Run `yarn install` (or `npm install`) in the repository root.
2. Run `yarn install` (or `npm install`) in the `examples` directory.
3. Run `yarn start` (or `npm run start`) in the `examples` directory.
4. Wait few seconds and browse examples that will open in new browser window.


## Installing

The current version assumes [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) >16.0.0 and [PIXI.js](https://github.com/pixijs/pixi.js) >4.4.0

    yarn add react-pixi-fiber

or

    npm install react-pixi-fiber --save

This package works flawlessly with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) – see examples above, they already use it.


## Migrating from [`react-pixi`](https://github.com/Izzimach/react-pixi)

It is possible to use React Pixi Fiber as a drop-in replacement for `react-pixi`. 

> Please note that it has only been tested with basic scenarios – it is not guaranteed to work flawlessly. 

There are two options:

### Changing `import` / `require` statements

Change:
    
    import ReactPIXI from "react-pixi";
    // or
    const ReactPIXI = require("react-pixi");

to:
 
    import ReactPIXI from "react-pixi-fiber/react-pixi-alias";
    // or
    const ReactPIXI = require("react-pixi-fiber/react-pixi-alias");

### Using `webpack` resolve `alias`

    resolve: {
      alias: {
        'react-pixi$': 'react-pixi-fiber/react-pixi-alias'
      }
    }


## API

### Components

React Pixi Fiber currently supports following components:

#### `<Stage />`

[Root Container](http://pixijs.download/release/docs/PIXI.Application.html#stage) of any [PIXI.js application](PIXIjs.download/release/docs/PIXI.Application.html).

Provides the following context:
* `app` – an instance of PIXI.js Application, with properties like:
  * `loader` – Loader instance to help with asset loading
  * `renderer` – WebGL or CanvasRenderer
  * `ticker` – Ticker for doing render updates
  * `view` – reference to the renderer's canvas element

#### `<Container />`

[PIXI.Container](http://pixijs.download/release/docs/PIXI.Container.html)

#### `<Graphics />`

[PIXI.Graphics](http://pixijs.download/release/docs/PIXI.Graphics.html)

#### `<Sprite />`

[PIXI.Sprite](http://pixijs.download/release/docs/PIXI.Sprite.html)

#### `<TilingSprite />`

[PIXI.extras.TilingSprite](http://pixijs.download/release/docs/PIXI.extras.TilingSprite.html)

#### `<Text />`

[PIXI.Text](http://pixijs.download/release/docs/PIXI.Text.html)

#### `<BitmapText />`

[PIXI.extras.BitmapText](http://pixijs.download/release/docs/PIXI.extras.BitmapText.html)
